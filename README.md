# Awesome-Video-Agent

A curated collection of papers, benchmarks, codebases, and other learning resources for building multimodal **video agents**. Inspired by the style of [Awesome Think With Images](https://github.com/zhaochen0110/Awesome_Think_With_Images), this repository organizes the latest progress on perception, reasoning, and action in video-driven systems.

## Updates
- **2024-08-12**: Repository initialized with structure modeled after Awesome Think With Images.

## Scope
This list focuses on resources that help build agents capable of understanding, reasoning over, and acting upon video streams. Relevant topics include:
- Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that ingest video inputs.
- Video captioning, QA, and temporal reasoning.
- Embodied or tool-using agents leveraging video perception.
- Planning, alignment, and safety for video-based autonomy.

## Resource Overview
Use the following sections as anchors for contributions:
- **Papers**: Novel architectures, training strategies, or agent designs centered on video understanding.
- **Benchmarks**: Public leaderboards or evaluation suites targeting temporal reasoning or agent capabilities.
- **Datasets**: Curated video corpora for supervised, self-supervised, or reinforcement learning.
- **Frameworks & Tooling**: Open-source libraries, model checkpoints, evaluation scripts, and agent stacks.
- **Tutorials & Courses**: Blog posts, walkthroughs, and lecture series focused on building video agents.

## Papers
_Organize papers chronologically (newest first) with concise summaries and links to code if available._
